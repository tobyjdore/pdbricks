# Introduction 
A quick connector between pandas and DataBricks for data analysts

#### Functionality:

linking pandas directly to the native DataBricks API
This allows us to:
- load dataframes directly to the filestore
- read CSV files from the filestore into a dataframe

linking pandas directly to DataBricks SQL
This allows us to:
- query tables on a DataBricks cluster and return as a dataframe
- create tables in a DataBricks cluster directly from a dataframe
